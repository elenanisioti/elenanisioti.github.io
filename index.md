Welcome to my academic and personal page. I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/nisio89304/eleni-nisioti) working on reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems. My main focus is the study of robustness and efficiency of learning algorithms in decentralized real-world settings and my research interests include Markov Decision Processes, Multi-armed Bandits, Game Theory, Recurrent Neural Networks and Information Theory.  

I also hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I majored in Electronics and Computers and conducted a Diploma thesis on automated machine learning.

In my academia-free time I enjoy blogging about Artificial Intelligence, literature and the history of science. I haeve also worked with different [medium publications](https://medium.com/applied-data-science) and [institutes](https://cognitivemarketinginstitute.de/en/blog-en/) as a freelance technology writer.
