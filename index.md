Welcome to my academic and personal page. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Essex working on reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems. My main theoretical focus is the study of robustness and efficiency of learning algorithms in real-world settings such as wireless networks.

In my academia-free time I enjoy blogging about Artificial Intelligence, literature and the history of science. I also work with different [publications](https://medium.com/applied-data-science) and [institutes](https://cognitivemarketinginstitute.de/en/blog-en/) as a freelance technology writer.
