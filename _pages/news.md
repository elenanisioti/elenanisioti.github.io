Some nice things that happened to me lately:

* (March 2020) I was accepted at the [Complex Systems summer school of the Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/schools/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school). Unfortunately postponed due to the pandemic, but I am looking forward to meeting fellow complexity-enthusiasts.
* (January 2020) I went on a three-month research visit at the [Intelligent and Autonomous Systems](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/intelligent-and-autonomous-systems) group at CWI, Amsterdam, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Bloembergen and Dr. Kaisers on robust temporal difference learning.
* (June 2019) I went on a two-week research visit at University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona under the [YERUN Mobility award scheme](https://www.yerun.eu/2019/10/its-open-the-3rd-yerun-research-mobility-awards-call-2019-2020/). My host supervisors were Prof. Bellalta, head of the Wireless Networking group, and Prof. Jonsson, head of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group.
* (May 2019) My [essay](https://365datascience.com/eleni-nisioti-scholarship-winner/) on Artificial Intelligence and Free will won the 365 Data Science scholarship competition.
